Kalman Kit
==========
Welcome to `Kalmankit` library docs. This packages provides a multidimensional
implementation of the standard and extended Kalman filter algorithms using
NumPy.

The Kalman filter is an optimal estimation algorithm: it estimates the true 
state of a signal given that this signal is noisy and/or incomplete. If the 
noises are drawn from a gaussian distribution and the underlying system is 
governed by linear equations, the filter will output the best possible estimate 
of the signal's true state.
