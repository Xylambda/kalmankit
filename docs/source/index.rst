Kalman Filter
=============
The Kalman filter is an optimal estimation algorithm: it estimates the true 
state of a signal given that this signal is noisy and/or incomplete. If the 
noises are drawn from a gaussian distribution and the underlying system is 
governed by linear equations, the filter will output the best possible estimate 
of the signal's true state.

This packages provides a multidimensional implementation of the standard Kalman 
filter algorithm using NumPy.
